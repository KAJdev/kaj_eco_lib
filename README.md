## Kaj's Economy library.
- provides rudimentary balances for players
- stores associated monetary values on the server, safe from cheating.
- easy way to set/add/remove money from each player.
- automatically sends new money value to client, and saves it on the server.

## Installation
- download the client side mod from the releases page, as well as the server side mod.
- put the server side mod into Resources/Server/ Directory on your Server. (edit config if needed)
